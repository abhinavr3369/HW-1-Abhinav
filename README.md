People who fail in their lives always have explanations. Successful people, they have no explanation. They know it's endless striving. There is simply no other way. No situation should whip you for you to be in full force. You must be in full force already. You will only do this if you are joyful and exuberant by your own nature. Only when you are joyful, are you willing to go full-on. Little frustration, a little depression, then you think "Maybe this is my fate". No, this is not your fate. You are finding an explanation for your lethargy or your failure.
